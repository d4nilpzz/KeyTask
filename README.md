KeyTask
---
### Instalation
To install the program you need to make a folder at `C:\d4nilpzz\KeyTask` and drag the zip file downloaded from the release into the folder that we make before.
Once in it, you have to decompress and then, they would have to appear 4 files in it. One the `KeyTask.exe` file and his 2 images and a config file `shortcut.json`.

Now you can run the executable file and it should appear a try icon with the app.

By default the app has this shortcuts, and you can try it.
```json
{
  "ctrl+alt+j": "msg * 'Este es un mensaje'"
}
```

### Making your first shortcut
To make your first shortcut just right click to the try icon and press `Edit Shortcut`
Now in the UI you can edit create, edit & delete your shortcuts. You can use this keys with the format that appears at the example.
```
ctrl
alt
win
shift
```
All of this chained together by a `+`

### Settings
You can put the program to startup application with high priority.

Also at the try icon you can just `enable` or `disable` the program without stoping the application.
